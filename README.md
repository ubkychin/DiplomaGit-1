## Practice branching, pull requests and merging as a team

This is a simple application that reads products from a MongoDB.

**Product**

Name: string

Qty: int

Price: float

In teams of 2 or 3 you must:

One person should fork this repo before you begin.  Others should fork from that one **or** add other members to the repo
- Complete the Class Library
- Complete the API - _instructions on how to access the DB are in a ReadMe file on that project_
- Write some units tests for the class library

Each member of the team should do one of the above tasks
- branches must be used
- pull requests must be used
- the final merge must be fully functional


_Please be aware that the DB is being used by other groups.  Refrain from interacting with the DB inappropriatley_

#GitFlow

- The database now has a customers table and api

**Customer**
Username: string

email: string


You now need to create an controller and models for user and add to the project
- create a development branch
- create a User model and Users if necessary
- create the controller for user -> GET by username, GET all and POST user are the endpoint required 

- GitFlow must be used
- main/master will be the production branch
- pull requests must be used
- the final merge must be fully functional
