## Practice branching, pull requests and merging as a team

This is a simple application that reads products from a MongoDB.

**Product**
Name: string
Qty: int
Price: float

In teams of 2 or 3 you must:

Fork this repo before you begin
- Complete the Class Library
- Complete the API - _instructions on how to access the DB are in a ReadMe file on that project_
- Write some units tests for the class library

Each member of the team should do one of the above tasks
- branches must be used
- pull requests must be used
- the final merge must be fully functional


_Please be aware that the DB is being used by other groups.  Refrain from interacting with the DB inappropriatley_
